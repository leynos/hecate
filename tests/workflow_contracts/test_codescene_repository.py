"""The CV-005 contract over this repository's own workflows.

Main owns CodeScene: one push-to-main publisher uploads coverage and
writes the ratchet baseline, and nothing a pull request can start talks
to CodeScene or holds its credential. The rule tests beside this module
prove each clause refuses the shape it exists to refuse.
